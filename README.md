# Post Puppy

Post Puppy is a Slack app for the Hack Club Slack that lets you view all your shipments from Hack Club inside Slack. ~No need to leave Slack? More time to get addicted and talk to others!~ You can also let Post Puppy bark in channels to get notified when your shipment status changes.

Your email is fetched from Slack to get your shipments from the [Shipment Viewer](https://shipment-viewer.hackclub.com). If you use a different email, you can open the settings, enter your email, hit save and then click the verification link that you'll get sent.

By default, Post Puppy is, well, a puppy. But you can choose any language that you want... if it exists in the language file. Feel free to add your own language by making a PR updating `[postpuppy/utils/langs.py](https://github.com/transcental/PostPuppy/blob/main/postpuppy/utils/langs.py)`. Just duplicate the dog language and keep the same structure.

If you have any feeedback, please open an issue or DM me on Slack! You can find me [@amber](https://https://hackclub.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=U054VC2KM9P)
